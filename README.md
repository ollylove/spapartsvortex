# spapartsvortex test

Hi,

Here is the whole test I made in about 7 hours and a half. 
The test is devided into 4 folders, one for each task. 
There is also a spreadsheet file called Notes which contains the chronological order of the tasks I made, with relative duration taken to complete.

Note: I wasn't sure whether the slideshow had to be a file or a website, hence I opted for a web slideshow. I could easily convert this into a powerpoint slideshow, if it was necessary.

Please, have a look at each task and let me know if the result meets your expectations.

Thank you! 
Olga
